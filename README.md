Step 1: Creating the Database and Tables

I started by creating a database called EcommerceDB.
Inside it, I made 5 tables:

Customers â€“ to store customer details.

Products â€“ to store product information with prices.

Orders â€“ to record when customers place an order.

OrderDetails â€“ to link orders and products with quantities.

Payments â€“ to keep track of how each order was paid.

This structure helped normalize the data and avoid duplication.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Inserting Sample Data

I inserted sample records for:

Customers (like Ravi, Priya, Amit, etc.)

Products (Laptop, Smartphone, Shoes, etc.)

Orders and their details (who bought what, when, and how much).

Payments with different payment methods.

This gave me enough data to test my queries.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Writing Queries

I wrote several queries to analyze the dataset:

Top Customers â€“ to find customers who spent the most.

Best-Selling Products â€“ to see which products had the highest sales.

Monthly Sales Revenue â€“ to track sales trends month by month.

Delhi Customersâ€™ Orders â€“ to check orders from customers in Delhi.

Highest Value Order â€“ to identify the single order with the biggest payment.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Observing Results

After running the queries, I got useful insights:

Ravi Sharma appeared as a top customer.

Laptops and Smartphones were among the best-selling products.

February had higher revenue compared to other months.

I could see which customers from Delhi placed orders and how much they spent.

I found the most expensive order in the dataset.
